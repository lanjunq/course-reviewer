I took cis 550 with Prof. ? and it was a great course. the course is structured, with lots of good knowledge, including SQL, javascript. I'd recommend to students.

You don't need much prior knowledge about database to take 550.

545 is big data analytics, teaches you tool to perform big data calculation. Relatively easy. Uses python and libraries. 

555 is insane.

555 is insane.

555 is challenging. about 40 hours a week. prior knowledge about java and concurrent programming would be helpful.

taking 548 prior to 555 may be helpful.

i don't know about 548, but 555 is hard. I dream about 555. I learn 555 while I eat. prof is very nice. I learned a great deal from this course.
