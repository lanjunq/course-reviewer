# Course Reviewer

### Problem to solve
Penn Course Review is a great source of information when it comes to help student select the right course. It provides sufficient quantitative numbers for students to compare courses from various aspects. 

However, Penn Course Review misses two things. First, there is no student comments available. 

The purpose of this application is to create a course review system that aggregate students' qualitative comments on different courses and present the comments in a beautiful UI to the users. This should theoretically provide additional information to the students and help them better understand the course. 

### Workflow
The basic workflow of the application is the following
